How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs will generally start with the analysis of the system.  This can be done by asking the team for feedback, and communicating with the Product Owner on feedback.  Pass/fail perameters should be identified as well. User stories can help with gathering this information because this is where the users can express their needs and wants.  Looking at the user stories will help us understand the end users perspective. This can be especially helpful as team members may not have the perspectives that are as important to the end user.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

You can approach developing programs in a couple different ways.  Waterfall Method is one strategy.  Waterfall helps in projecting the needs of a specific strategy. Another method is Agile. Agile offers a much more flexible strategy and it is a more unique way to work with testing, planning and client integration. The feedback loop present in Agile will keep fresh ideas coming through and lead to a better overall product.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Communication is the most important aspect in terms of being a good team member. Being open to collaboration and feedback fosters a healthy relationship with your team mates and allows for a greater team morale and better overall resulting product. Understanding your part of the project and making sure you are contributing your best work to the project goes a long way in a team environment.
